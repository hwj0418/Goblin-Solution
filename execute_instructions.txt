(Version 1)

Note: Because our program technically doesn't have a unified screen for both professors and students, for now you will have to execute different files for the student and professor version of the program.



Student: From the src folder, type python3 student_question_set.py in terminal to execute.

Professor: From the src folder, type python3  question_type_select.py in terminal to execute
